This project is implemented as a part of the
Coursera online course "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4"
Due to time limitations, only some part of the planned functionality is implemented. <br>
Also, just the front end part is developed avoiding, for simplication and learning reasons,
software design principles (like DRY).
The goal is to improve the project in the direct future.

- Grunt will be used for task automation

-- Execution --
